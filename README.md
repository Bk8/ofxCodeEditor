Add-on for splitting an openframeworks application window to display, edit, and access
the content of a real text editor based on Scintilla.

Scintilla is a multiplatorm open-source editor : http://www.scintilla.org/

For now, ofxCodeEditor supports only MacOSX (with cocoa glue code),
but GTK, and WIN32 support may be added, because Scintilla nativelly support them.
